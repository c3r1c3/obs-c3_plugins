C3's stuff for OBS Studio
==============================================================

So I needed and wanted to write some plug-ins and filters for OBS Studio that
might not fit the general use case. Jim wants to keep the overall codebase clean
and avoid unneccessary cruft in the core. That I appreciate and hope to help
support by releasing these plug-ins.

Also hopefully this series of plugins provides (overly) documented examples of
how to write the various types of plug-ins one can create in OBS Studio, and how
to create and build a project written for OBS Studio but kept outside the main
repo.

Each folder contains it's own README.rst file that contains details about the
plug-ins in said folder.
